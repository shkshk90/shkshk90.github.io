      <description>Introduction For the 2021&amp;rsquo;s summer, I participated in the Google Summer of Code.
I contributed to the VLC media player, through the project titled VLC macOS interface redesign.
Overview The goal for the project is to implement the newly designed interface for the next major release 4.0.
The new interface follows modern look and feel for macOS.
This interface is implemented in native Cocoa API, using Objective-C.
A basic implementation was already in-place, however, the UI/UX aspects were largerly not implemented.</description>
